# DS_Salary
Hi, this is my very first data science project.
This project was refferenced to https://www.youtube.com/c/KenJee1 for the code
and https://mersakarya.medium.com/selenium-tutorial-scraping-glassdoor-com-in-10-minutes-3d0915c6d905 for API scrapper

In this project, I am making a predictive model using scrapped data from Glassdoor about data science job.
This model will predict the salary of data scientists
